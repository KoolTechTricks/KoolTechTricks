# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Kool Tech Tricks!
This GitHub account is for storing sources and reporting issues to various projects.

I publish information for everyone, so that everyone can learn something new for themselves.

I'm not an expert, just an enthusiast, who does all the work alone in free time.

Kool Tech Wiki is a free resource, where you can find information for using useful software. There you can learn about new niche apps, alternatives to popular services, solutions for annoying problems and much more.

I'm striving to create an ultimate resource, where all the useful information will be stored and available to everyone. It will never get lost on the site, it's convenient to share with other people, and changes can be tracked. All the source texts of pages are available in the GitHub repository. Everyone can contribute.
